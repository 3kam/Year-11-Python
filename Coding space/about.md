# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, this is a simple game made from Python in the Github Codespace where I want players to try and guess a randomly generated number between 1 to 1000. You are only given 10 attempts to find the hidden number. Are you willing to find the hidden number?

## How to play guessing game

1. Install the Python extension for the VS code or the Github Codespace.  
2. A run icon will then appear which then you can run the script in a VS code or the Github Codespace.
3. The game will randomly select a number between 1 and 1000.
4. You're goal is to guess teh correct number within **10 attempts**.
5. After each guess you make you'll be given a feedback depending on how close your guess was.
   - `"Too low, try a higher number."`
   - `"Too high, try a lower number."`
   - `"You guessed the hidden number in x attempts. Well done!"`
6. If you fail the 10 attempts on guessing, you'll loose and the game would reveal the correct answer.
