# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, this is a simple game made from Python in the Github Codespace where I want players to try and guess a randomly generated number between 1 to 1000. You are only given 10 attempts to find the hidden number. Are you willing to find the hidden number?

## How to Play the guessing game
1. Install the Python extension in the Github Codespace

7. After each guess you make you'll be given a feedback depending on how close your guess was.
   - `"Too low, try a higher number."`
   - `"Too high, try a lower number."`
   - `"You guessed the hidden number in x attempts. Well done!"`
8. Given message for winners and loosers
Winner: If you win guessing under your 10 attempts, you'll already know the correct answer since you won.
