# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — Year 11 Software Engineering (NSW)

## Programming Fundamentals — core concepts applied

Review: functions, data structures and modular design — used to motivate why OOP helps manage complexity by bundling data and behaviour.

---

## Learning outcomes

* Understand and apply OOP concepts to model problems.
* Design class hierarchies and implement classes with attributes and methods.
* Use inheritance and polymorphism appropriately and test class behaviour.

---

## Topic overview

### Key concepts

* Classes and objects: attributes (data) and methods (behaviour).
* Encapsulation: access control, getters/setters.
* Constructors and initialisation.
* Inheritance and method overriding.
* Polymorphism and abstraction.

### Design skills

* UML basics: class diagrams, relationships.
* Mapping problem descriptions to classes and responsibilities.
* Modular code structure and separation of concerns.

### Practical activities

* Implement class hierarchies (e.g., `Person` → `Student` / `Teacher`).
* Build a small text-based simulation (inventory system, game entities).
* Convert a procedural program to OOP design and test.

### Assessment examples

* UML design document plus implemented classes.
* Refactor task: rewrite procedural code using classes.

## Suggested weekly breakdown (3–4 weeks)

1. Week 1: Introduction to classes and objects; simple examples.
2. Week 2: Encapsulation, constructors, methods; small exercises.
3. Week 3: Inheritance and polymorphism; project start.
4. Optional Week 4: UML diagrams, testing and refactoring.

## Resources & tools

* Language: Python (classes) or Java (if school prefers static typing).
* Tools: IDE (VS Code, PyCharm), UML drawing tools (draw\.io).
