# Mechatronics — Year 11 Software Engineering (NSW)

## Programming Fundamentals — core concepts applied

Review: variables, control flow and functions as they apply to embedded code: reading sensor values, making decisions, and controlling outputs.

---

## Learning outcomes

* Understand basics of electronics and microcontroller I/O.
* Interface sensors and actuators and write embedded programs to control them.
* Document circuit designs and test results; follow safety practices.

---

## Topic overview

### Core concepts

* Basic electronics: voltage, current, resistors, LEDs, circuit safety.
* Sensors: LDR, PIR, temperature sensors; Actuators: LEDs, motors, servos.
* Microcontrollers: Arduino/micro\:bit basics; digital vs analog I/O; PWM.
* Interfacing and debouncing; thresholds and simple control logic.

### Practical skills

* Breadboard wiring and circuit diagrams.
* Writing sketches: read sensor → decide → actuate.
* Data logging basics and documenting experiments.

### Practical activities

* Blink LED; read push button; control brightness with PWM.
* PIR motion sensor to switch on LED; LDR-based night light.
* Small project: automatic light, alarm, or temperature monitor with serial output.

### Assessment examples

* Lab report: circuit diagram, code, testing, evaluation.
* Mini-project combining sensor + microcontroller + actuator with demonstration.
