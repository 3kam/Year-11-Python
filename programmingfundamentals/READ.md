# Programming Fundamentals — Year 11 Software Engineering (NSW)

## Programming Fundamentals — core concepts applied

A concise refresher: variables, data types, arithmetic & logical operators, input/output, sequence, selection (`if`/`else`), iteration (`for`, `while`), functions (definition, parameters, return values), basic debugging, and commenting/documentation.

---

## Learning outcomes

* Apply core programming constructs to solve problems.
* Decompose problems and implement solutions using functions and basic data structures.
* Test and debug simple programs and document work clearly.

---

## Topic overview

### Core concepts

* Data types: integer, float, boolean, string, arrays/lists.
* Variables and assignment; expressions and operators.
* Control structures: sequence, selection, iteration.
* Functions: definitions, parameters, returns, scope.
* Basic I/O: console input/output and simple file I/O (optional).
* Simple algorithms: searching, basic sorting concept.

### Programming practices

* Pseudocode and flowcharts; problem decomposition.
* Naming conventions, comments, readability.
* Testing basics: unit checks, edge cases, assertion use.

### Practical activities

* Short programs: calculator, grade converter, number-guessing game.
* Lists/arrays practice: averages, searching, simple aggregation.
* Function library: write and reuse helper functions.

### Assessment examples

* Workbook of coding tasks (5–8 problems).
* Practical program with documentation and test cases.
